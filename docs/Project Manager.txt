The Project Manager for Ruin is available on github:
https://nexus-webdev.github.io/Ruin/Manager.html?id=<project id>#;

Currently, only dark mode works correctly (because I'm too lazy to fix light mode).
The textarea at the top of the page acts as a config in which you can:
* Define an encryption key (encoding: <key>),
* Define a prefix (prefix: <prefix>),
* Define the project name (project: <name>);

The following are customized keybinds for the manager:
* Ctrl + Shift + r - Reopen the manager as a window,
* Ctrl + Shift + f - Make the editor (iframe) fullscreen,
* Ctrl + s - Save to the filesystem,
* Ctrl + Alt + s - Save to the filesystem (overriding the current filehandle),
* Ctrl + m - Load a directory into the manager,
* Alt + s - Save to the localStorage only,
* Alt + r - Replace the text in a specific area,
* Alt + o - Execute the code in ruin,
* Alt + m - toggle menu,
